### Hey there! 👋

I'm **Rei**, a software engineer based in the Philippines.

I build scalable web applications and explore the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Modern Software Architecture**.

I enjoy the process of turning complex problems into elegant, user-centric solutions. If a challenge catches my interest, I'll likely spend my nights architecting a way to solve it.

My main tech stack revolves around **TypeScript (Next.js/NestJS)** and the **.NET Ecosystem (C#/ASP.NET)**. For intelligence, I leverage **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow** to build and deploy ML models.

Currently, I'm working on core web initiatives at [**Hayahai**](https://hayahai.id) while finishing my final year in Computer Science at **CIT-U**.

Beyond the code, I'm a firm believer in continuous learning—whether it's mastering a new framework or refining system performance.

#### Fun Facts:
- 🐱 I'm a huge cat lover.
- ☕ I fuel my late-night coding sessions with more caffeine than I probably should (I also barely sleep).
- 🏗️ I love building in public and shipping side projects.
- ⚡ Always down to talk about AI, distributed systems, or the latest in web tech.
